**_HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model_**  

-HTML provides us with three different type of lists : 

>- **Ordered lists** are lists where each item in the list is numbered  
>- **Unordered** lists are lists that begin with a bullet point  
>- **Definition lists** are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms

## Lists
>- The ordered list is created with the (ol) element,Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag
and a closing (/li) tag  
>- The unordered list is created with the (ul) element, Each item in the list is placed between an opening (li) tag
and a closing (/li) tag  
>- Lists can be nested inside one another  

### Border, Margin & Padding

>- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.  
>- 1- Border : Every box has a border (even if it is not visible), The border separates the edge of one box from another  
>- 2- Margin : sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create agap between the borders of two djacent boxes.  
>- 3- Padding : is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents  

>- The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.
>- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.  
>- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.  
>- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.

**_ARRAYS_**  
>- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.  
>- You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable.  
>- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero  
>- To access a value from an array,after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside square brackets.  

#### Decisions and Loops  

>- A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value, Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.  
>- JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation, This is known as type coercion  
For example, a string 'l ' could be converted to a number 1 in the following expression:(' 1' > 0).  
>- JavaScript is said to use **weak typing** because the data type for a value can change, Some other languages require that you specify what data type each variable will be , They are said to use **strong typing**

**_TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES_**

>- Due to type coercion, every value in JavaScript can be treated as if it were true or false; and this has some interesting side effects.  
>- Truthy values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can
be treated as if it were true.
