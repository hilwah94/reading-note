**_Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables_**

>**What is a table ?**  
>A table represents information in a grid format like sport results for example  
>Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell.

>**Basic Table Structure :**

>(**table :**) The (**table**) element is used to create a table. The contents of the table In HTML is written out  row by row.  
>(tr) You indicate the start of each row using the opening (tr) tag, (The tr stands for table row.)  
>It is followed by one or more (td) elements (one for each cell in that row), At the end of the row you use a closing (/tr) tag.  
>(td) Each cell of a table is represented using a (td) element, (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing (/td) tag.  
>(th) The (th) element is used just like the (td) element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for tableheading.)  
>Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a (td) or (th) element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly.  
>Using (th) elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search enginesto index your pages, and also enables you to control the appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.  
>You can use the scope attribute on the (th) element to indicate whether it is a heading for a column or a row. It can take the values:  
>row to indicate a heading for a row, or col to indicate a heading for a column  

>**SPANNING COLUMNS :** The colspan attribute can be used on a (th) or (td) element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.  

>**SPANNING ROWS :**You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row, The rowspan attribute can be used on a (th) or (td) element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

>**Long Tables :**There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table andthe first and last rows (which can contain different content), These elements help people who use screen readers and also allow you to style these sections in a different manner than the rest of the table.

>1- (thead) : The headings of the table should sit inside the (thead) element.  
>2- (tbody) : The body should sit inside the (tbody) element.  
>3- (tfoot) : The footer belongs inside the (tfoot) element.  

>**Creating an object : constructor notation**  
>the {new} keyword and object constructor create a blank object .  
>you can then add properties and methods to the object.  
>first, you can create a new object using a combination of the {new} key word and the object () constructor function
>next, having created the blank object, you can add properties and methods to it using dot notation  
>each statement that adds a property of method should ends with semi colon ";".  

>**EX : let hotel = newObject ()**;  
>**to create an embty object using literal notation use let hotel = {} , the curly brackets create an embty object**  

>**Updating an object :** to update the value of properties, use dot notation or square brackets, they work on objects created using literal or constructor notation, to delete a property use the {delete} key word

>**CREATING MANY OBJECTS: CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION**

>Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things, Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects,First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.  
>**CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS** 
>In both of these examples, the object is created on the first line of the code sample, The properties and methods are then added to it afterwards.  
>Once you have created an object, the syntax for adding or removing any properties and methods from that object is the same.  
>**CREATING AN OBJECT WITH PROPERTIES & METHODS :**  
>1- LITERAL NOTATION A colon separates the key/value pairs, There is a comma between each key/value pair.  
>2- OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION : The function can be used to create multiple objects, The this keyword is used instead of the object name.  
>**THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD) :** The keyword {this} is commonly used inside functions and objects, Where the function is declared alters what this means, It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.  
>When a function is created at the top level of a script (that is, not inside another object or function), then it is in the global scope or global context.  

>**A METHOD OF AN OBJECT :** When a function is defined inside an object, it becomes a method. In a method, this refers to the containing object.  
>In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs, To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values, In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.  

>**VARIABLES :** A variable has just one key (the variable name) and one value.  
>Variable names are separated from their value by an equals sign (the assignment operator)  

>**ARRAYS :** Arrays can store multiple pieces of information, Each piece of information is separated by a comma, The order of the values is important because items in an array are assigned a number (called an index), Values in an array are put in square brackets, separated by commas.  
>You can think of each item in the array as another key/value pair, the key is the index number, and thevalues are shown in the comma-separated list.  
>If you want to access items via a property name or key, use an object (but note that each key in the object must be unique), If the order of the items is important, use an array.  

>**INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS :** Objects store sets of name/value pairs, They can be properties (variables) or methods (functions), The order of them is not important (unlike the array), You access each piece of data by its key, In object literal notation, properties and methods of an object are given in curly braces.    

>**MULTIPLE OBJECTS :**When you need to create multiple objects within the same page, you should use an object constructor to provide a template for the objects.

>**Arrays are objects :** arrays are actually special type of objects, they hold a related set of key/value pairs , (like all objects), but the key for each value is it's index number.  

>**Arrays of object and object of arrays**  
>you can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structure :  
>arrays can store a series of objects (and remember thier order), objects can also hold arrays (As a vlaue of their properties).
