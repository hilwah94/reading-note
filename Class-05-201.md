## Images, Color, Text

>**IMAGES :** it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.  
>To add an image into the page you need to use an (img) element, This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag), It must carry the following two attributes:  
>1- src : this tells the browser where it can find the image file, This will usually be a relative URL  
>2- alt : this provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it  
>You will also often see an (img) element use two other attributes that specify its size: **height & width**  
>Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed  
>Three Rules for Creating Images :  
>1-Save images in the right format like png or jpg  
>2- Save images at the right size  
>3- Use the correct resolution  
>Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

### COLOR

>The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:  
>1- rgb values These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up  
>2- hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color  
>3- Color names : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers  
>HUE : hue is near to the colloquial idea of color  
>SATURATION : Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color  
>BRIGHTNESS : (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color, At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.  
>When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.  
>Lightness This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.  
>alpha This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ,For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75  
>represents 75% transparency.

#### TEXT 
  
>**_typeface Terminology:_**   
>1- Serif : Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letter  
>2- Sans-Serif : have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.  
>3- Monospace : Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width, (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)  
>When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer.  
>Cursive : Cursive fonts either have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics, such as handwriting styles  
>Fantasy fonts : are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not designed for long bodies of text.  
>Browsers are supposed to support at least one typeface from each of the groups above. For this reason, it is common to add the generic font name after your preferred choice of typefaces.

**_FONT FAMILY :_** 
>If a font name is made up of more than one word, it should be put in double quotes.  
>Designers suggest pages usually look better if they use no more than three typefaces on a page.

>**_font-size :_**The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font,  
>There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:  
>1- pixels Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is followed by the letters px  
>2- percentages : The default size of text in browsers is 16px, So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.  

>**_The font-weight_** property allows you to create bold text, There are two values that this property commonly takes:  
>a- normal This causes text to appear at a normal weight.  
>b- bold This causes text to appear bold

>**_The-font-style :_**  
>1- normal : This causes text to appear in a normal style (as opposed to italic or oblique).  
>2- italic This causes text to appear italic.  
>3- oblique This causes text to appear oblique.

>**_text-transform :_** The text-transform property is used to change the case of text giving it one of the following values:  
>1- uppercase This causes the text to appear uppercase  
>2- lowercase This causes the text to appear lowercase.
>3- capitalize This causes the first letter of each word to appear capitalized  

>**_text-decoration :_** The text-decoration property allows you to specify the following values:  
>1- none : This removes any decoration already applied to the text.  
>2- underline : This adds a line underneath the text.  
>2- overline This adds a line over the top of the text.  
>3- line-through This adds a line through words.  
>4- blink This animates the text to make it flash on and off  

>**_text-align :_** The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values:  
>1- left : This indicates that the text should be left-aligned.  
>2- right : This indicates that the text should be right-aligned.  
>3- center : This allows you to center text.  
>4- justify : This indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.

> You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
> You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
