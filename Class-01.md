>-HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages  
opening tag and a closing tag 

**_How the Web Works_**  
>-When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the  
>world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect  
>to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.  

**_Structure_**

>-Tags act like containers.They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and  closing tags.  
>-Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.   
>-To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

**_ExtraMarkup_**  
>-Doc types Because there have been several versions of HTML, each  
>web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.  
>-use this "<!-?-If you want to add a comment-->"  
>-Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements  on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is  
important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes.  
>-The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element  
>-Block Elements needs a new line to start & inline elements can be inline  
>-(div) allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.  
>-(span)acts like an inline equivalent of the (div) element and The most common reason why  
>-people use (span) elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS  
>-Class Attribute ,rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a  
>way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.  
>-(iframes) cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.  
>-Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as  
>-The (nav) element is used to contain the major navigationalblocks on the site  
>-The (section) element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading  
>-Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site  
>-Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.  
>-Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.  
You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style
