**_Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM_**  

>WHAT IS AN OBJECT?  
>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.  
>If a function is part of an object, it is called a method, Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object.  
>If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property, Properties tell us about the object  
>The simplest way to create an object literal is to assign an empty object to a variable.  
>For example: var foo = {}; That is it. In that one line, you have created an object literal.  
>Now, that object is empty.  

>**As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page.**  
>**The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory.**  
>**It consists of four main types of nodes.**  

>ACCESSING ELEMENTS : DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,which is a collection of nodes.
