**_Forms and JS Events_**  
>## Forms :  

>**Why forms ?** The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage, In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions  >online.  
>**_Form Controls :_** There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site  
>**1- ADDING TEXT :**Text input (single-line) Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names.  
>**2- Password input :** Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.  
>**3- Text area :** (multi-line) For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments
>**_Making Choices :_**  
>**1- Radio buttons :** For use when a user must select one of a number of options.  
>**2- Checkboxes :** When a user can select and unselect one or more options.  
>**3- Drop-down boxes :** When a user must pick one of a number of options from a list
>**_Submitting Forms :_**  
>1- Submit buttons To submit data from your form to another web page.   
>2- Image buttons Similar to submit buttons but they allow you to use an image.  
>**_Uploading files :_** File upload Allows users to upload files (e.g. images) to a website. 

>**_How Forms Work ?_** A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.  
>A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

>**_Form Structure_**  
>**a- (Form) :** Form controls live inside a (Form) element, This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too  
>**b- action :** Every (form) element requires an action attribute, Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.  
>**c- method :** Forms can be sent using one of two methods : get or post, With the get method, the values  from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute.  
>With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form.  
>if the method attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using the get method.  

>**1- TEXT INPUT :** a- (input) The (input) element is used to create several different form controls, The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.  
>b- type="text" When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input, name When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each piece of data was entered into.  
>c- maxlength You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field, Its value is the number of characters they may enter.  

>**2-Password Input :** a- (input) type="password" When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.  
>b- name The name attribute indicates the name of the password input.  
>c- size, maxlength It can also carry the size and maxlength attributes like the the single-line text input.  

>**3-Text Area :** = (textarea) element is used to create a mutli-line text input, Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element, It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag. 

>**4- Radio Button :** a- type="radio" Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.  
>b- name : The name attribute is sent to the server with the value of the option the user selects.  
>c- value : The value attribute indicates the value that is sent to the server for the selected option.  
>checked The checked attribute can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected when the page loads, The value of this attribute is checked. Only one radio button in a group should use this attribute.  

>**5-Check Box :** type="checkbox" Checkboxes allow users to select (and unselect) one or more options in answer to a question.  

>**Drop Down List Box :** (select) A drop down list box (also known as a select box) allows users to select one option from a drop down list, The (select) element is used to create a drop down list box, It contains two or more (option) elements. 

>Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.  
>HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.  

>**button :** The (button) element was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear, and to allow other elements to appear inside the button, This means that you can combine text and images between the opening (button) tag and closing (button) tag. 

>**input :** type="hidden" This example also shows a hidden form control, These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the View Source option in the browser), They allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.  

>**Labelling Form Controls :** (label) When introducing form controls, the code was kept simple by indicating the purpose of each one in text next to it. However, each form control should have its own (label) element as this makes the form accessible to vision-impaired users.  

>The (label) element can be used in two ways, It can:  
>1- Wrap around both the text description and the form input  
>2- Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to indicate which form control it is a label for.  

>**for :** The for attribute states which form control the label belongs to, Note how the radio buttons use the id attribute, The value of the id attribute uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page  

>id attributes can be used on any form control. When a (label) element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users can click on either the form control or the label to select.  

**Grouping Form Elements :**  

>(fieldset) You can group related form controls together inside the (fieldset) element, This is particularly helpful for longer forms, Most browsers will show the fieldset with a line around the edge to show how they are related.  
>(legend) The (legend) element can come directly after the opening (fieldset) tag and contains a caption which helps identify the purpose of that group of form controls.  

>**Form Validation :** You have probably seen forms on the web that give users messages if the form control has not been filled in correctly; this is known as form validation.  

>**Date input :** Many forms need to gather information such as dates, email addresses, and URLs, This has traditionally been done using text inputs.  
>type="date" If you are asking the user for a date, you can use an (input) element and give the type attribute a value of date, This will create a date input in browsers that support the new HMTL5 input types.  

>**HTML5: Email & URL Input**  
>(input) HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email addresses and URLs, Browsers that do not support these input types will just treat them as text boxes.  
>type="email" If you ask a user for an email address, you can use the email input  
>type="url" A URL input can be used when you are asking a user for a web page address

## BULLET & Point & Styles 

>**list-style-type :**  
>The list-style-type property allows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point (also known as a marker), It can be used on rules that apply to the (ol), (ul), and (li) elements, Unordered Lists For an unordered list you can use the following values :  
> none  
> disc   
> circle  
> square  
>Ordered Lists : For an ordered (numbered) list you can use the following values:  
> decimal  
> 1 2 3 
> decimal-leading-zero  
> 01 02 03  
> lower-alpha  
> a b c
> upper-alpha  
> A B C  
> lower-roman  
> i. ii. iii.  
> upper-roman  
> I II III  

>You can specify an image to act as a bullet point using the list-style-image property, The value starts with the letters url and is followed by a pair of parentheses, Inside the parentheses, the path to the image is given inside double quotes, This property can be used on rules that apply to the (ul) and (li) elements.  
 
>**Positioning the Marker : Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-styleposition property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points, This property can take one of two values : 
> 1- Outside The marker sits to the left of the block of text, (This is the default behaviour if this property is not used.)  
> 2- inside The marker sits inside the box of text (which is indented).  

>**List Shorthand** As with several of the other CSS properties, there is a property that acts as a shorthand for list styles, It is called list-style, and it allows you to express the markers' style, image and position properties in any order.  

>**Table Properties :** You have already met several properties that are commonly used with tables, Here we will put them together in a single example using the following.  
> width to set the width of the table  
> padding to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content  
> text-transform to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase
> letter-spacing, font-size to add additional styling to the content of the table headers  
> border-top, border-bottom to set borders above and below the table headers  
> text-align to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others  
> background-color to change the background color of the alternating table rows  
>:hover to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it
